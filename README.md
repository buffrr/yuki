  <h1>Yuki: Light-ish Bitcoin Client</h1>
</div>

## About

Yuki is a fork of [Kyoto](https://github.com/2140-dev/kyoto) to experiment with:

- Parallel block & filter downloads distributed across peers.
- Persistence of blocks & filters.
- Yuki loads blocks & filters significantly faster.
- Since Yuki is experimental, stable APIs aren't guaranteed, but you could run it as a binary providing a minimal RPC interface lossely compatible with Bitcoin Core.

## To run Yuki

```
$ yuki

Yuki is litensing at http://localhost:8225
```
